24/01/2019	How easy is it to understand consumer finance?	Economics Letters	We ask if consumer finance websites are easy enough to understand. Our results show that all consumer finance websites are hard to read.	"Burke, M., & Fry, J. (2019). How easy is it to understand consumer finance?.

30/12/2021	Climate Change and Fiscal Sustainability: Risks and Opportunities	National Institute Economic Review	"Both the physical and transition-related impacts of climate change pose substantial macroeconomic risks. Yet, markets still lack credible estimates of how climate change will affect debt sustainability, sovereign creditworthiness and the public finances of major economies. We present a taxonomy for tracing the physical and transition impacts of climate change through to impacts on sovereign risk. We then apply the taxonomy to the UK potential transition to net zero. Meeting internationally agreed climate targets will require an unprecedented structural transformation of the global economy over the next two or three decades. The changing landscape of risks warrants new risk management and hedging strategies to contain climate risk and minimise the impact of asset stranding and asset devaluation. Yet, conditional on action being taken early, the opportunities from managing a net zero transition would substantially outweigh the costs."

24/06/2022	Attention to Authority: The behavioural finance of Covid-19	Finance Research Letters	"In this paper we investigate the predictability of cryptocurrency returns following increases in Covid-19 cases/deaths. We find that the rate of government intervention moderates the impact that Covid-19 cases/deaths have on cryptocurrency returns. We show that in periods of tightening government intervention, increases in Covid-19 cases positively predict cryptocurrency returns. We argue that this is due to investors imputing their expectations of the pandemic through a 'combined' signal."	"Burke, M., Fry, J., Kemp, S., & Woodhouse, D. (2022).
